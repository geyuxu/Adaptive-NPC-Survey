# Adaptive AI Architectures & Player Immersion

> **Type:** Systematic Critical Review (MSc Research Project)
> **Keywords:** Deep RL, Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), Narrative Consistency

## 📝 Abstract
This research investigates the trade-off between **Adaptive AI architectures** (specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning) and **Player Immersion**. We identify a critical **"Evidence Gap"**: while engineering literature optimizes for agent performance, it often neglects the subjective impact on narrative coherence.

## 🔍 Methodology
We conducted a systematic review using the **SPIDER framework**, analyzing three distinct clusters:
1.  **Adaptive NPC Behaviour** (e.g., RL-based agents)
2.  **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)**
3.  **Challenge Measurement** (Critique of the **CORGIS scale**)

## 📊 Key Findings
* **The "Believability" Trade-off:** Highly adaptive agents can break immersion if their behavior becomes "too optimal" or inconsistent with the game's lore.
* **Measurement Gap:** Current studies rely heavily on post-hoc surveys rather than real-time telemetry to measure player challenge.

## 🧠 Contribution
Synthesized conflicting research perspectives to propose a new model for evaluating "Narrative-Consistent Adaptation".
